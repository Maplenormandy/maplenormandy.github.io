Hello world! I like turbulence, fundamental research, teaching, and work which has a socially-conscious impact. This site is my personal academic website, where you can find an overview of my research, teaching, and other such things. Feel free to browse around using the links in the navigation bar!

The best way to reach me is by my email, which is currently [firstname].[lastname]@cims.nyu.edu.
